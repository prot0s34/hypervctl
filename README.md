# hypervctl
experiments with spf13/cobra to build kubectl %) analog for fast-interacting with hyper-v 

this is funny diy tool and strongly not-recommended to use it anywhere except super-trusted isolated network. 
For more seriously use - needed to implement here safe connections methods.


TODO:
- find more elegant way to communicate with hyper-v instead of winrm remote conn
- improve auth methods
- make clean describe (vm,switch) func
